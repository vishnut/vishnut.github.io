										<h2>Semester 5 of 6</h2>

									<p>Two years in. I will be taking five more Computer Science Upper Division Electives before
										I graduate. I am taking three of those this semester.</p>

									</p>
									<h4>Spring 2017</h4>
									<b>CS373: Software Engineering with Dr. Glenn Downing</b>
									<p><a href="http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/downing/cs373/" target="_blank">Course Website</a><br />
									Overall, this is a fantanstic class and it is a must-take, not because of the content specifically, 
									but because of the teaching style of Professor Downing. That said, the content is oriented towards 
									getting students prepared for modern software engineering. We focus on testing and using tools such
									as AWS, ReactJS, SQLAlchemy, coverage, Docker, CI, Pylint, and PostgresSQL.</p>
									<a href="http://vishnut.me/CS373" class="button small">My Software Engineering Blog</a><br/><br/>
									<b>CS331: Algorithms and Complexity with Dr. Dana Moshkovitz</b>
									<p><a href="http://www.cs.utexas.edu/~danama/" target="_blank">Professor Website</a><br />
									This class focuses on Algorithm design and complexity theory. We learn about Dynamic Programming, 
									Divide and Conquer, Graph Theory, Network Flow, Linear Programming, NP, Approximation, and 
									Computability to name a few.</p>
									<h4>Fall 2016</h4>									
									<b>CS439: Principles of Computer Systems (OS) with Dr. Alison Norman</b>
									<p><a href="http://www.cs.utexas.edu/~ans/classes/cs439/index.html" target="_blank">Course Website</a><br />
									This has been one of my favorite courses at UT. This intensive class convers topics
									related to systems programming in general (synchronization, deadlocks, security, etc.) 
									and the development of operating systems. As projects, we had to design and implement
									various parts of the OS (User Programs, Virtual Memory, File System). It was a lot of 
									work and a lot of fun.</p> 
									<b>CS378: Computational Intelligence in Design with Dr. Cem Tutum</b>
									<p>This course lasted two semesters and was offered as part of the 
									<a href="https://cns.utexas.edu/fri" target="_blank">FRI (Freshman Research 
									Initiative)</a> program. The course covers evolutionary algorithms with
									a focus on genetic algorithms, neural networks, 3D printing, and surrogate-based
									optimization. In the first semester, we learned about these techniques and used
									them in short projects. <br/><br/>
									The second semester, though, was left as independent 
									research. We were free to choose any current topic within machine learning 
									and with guidance from Dr. Tutum, we were to work on the project for the semester.
									My partner and I worked on converting chess videos to text. There are several challenges here.
									First, we need to be able to recognize and remove the background from an image. Next, we
									need to split the chess board into 64 squares. Then, we need to be able to figure out
									the square color, presence of a piece, piece color, and piece type for every square.
									This requires a large data set and a convolutional neural network. After this step,
									we need to be able to decide which frames to pick from a video so that we have a before 
									and after picture of the board without any interference (hands). Comparing the two images,
									we then figure out what squares have changed, feed the sqaures to the neural network 
									again and maybe update our previous guesses on what each piece on the board really is. For 
									example, if we think that a piece is a rook but it moves both diagonally and side-to-side
									during a game, it must actually have been a queen. Of course, if the video starts from the
									beginning of the game, we can be sure what each piece is. <br/><br/>

									<a href="./assets/pdfs/VishnuFinalReport.pdf" class="button small">Final Report</a>
									<br/><br/>In this manner, there were many challenges that we had to solve during the semester 
									while working on the project. While the GitHub repository is still private, I have exported 
									my reports from iPython Notebook and published them here. Feel free to check them out.
									The report is certainly not complete and there have been a number of updates to the project 
									since the time of writing the report as it was rushed to be ready in time for the presentation. 
									I will update this page if the actual GitHub repository is made public.</p>
									<h4>Spring 2016</h4>																		
									<b>CS429: Computer Organization and Architecture with Dr. Bill Young</b>
									<p><a href="https://www.cs.utexas.edu/~byoung/cs429/syllabus429.html" target="_blank">Course Website</a><br />
									The focus of CS429 was the low-level workings of computers. Of course, when I say low-level, it is 
									relative to the other CS courses. We worked with x86, y86, and C. There were a number of exciting 
									projects in this class such as the Bomb Lab where you had to use GDB to debug and solve problems in
									an interactive lab. The answers could be as simple as a 5 letter word or as complex as a long alpha-numeric
									mess. Everytime we submitted a wrong answer, we would lose points on our grade but with the right technique,
									such labs were a great experience.</p>
									<h4>Fall 2015</h4>																											
									<b>CS314: Data Structures with Dr. Gordan Novak</b>
									<p><a href="https://www.cs.utexas.edu/~novak/cs314.html" target="_blank">Course Website</a><br />
									Having skipped the first CS class using high school credits, this was the first Computer Science
									class I took at UT. It covers the fundamentals of CS and of course, data structures. We talked 
									about Big O, recursion, trees, linked lists, arrays, stacks/queues, etc. Apart from this, we
									also covered Dijkstra's, Prim's, A* search, and MapReduce.</p>
