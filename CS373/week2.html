	<h1>Week 2</h1>
	<h3>Software Engineering (CS 373) Spring 2017</h3>
</header>
<b>What did you do this past week?</b>
<p>I have spent a lot more time on personal projects and coursework this week. I have gotten used to my schedule, of course,
	by now. For Software Engineering, specifically, this week, we talked about Coverage and tested it on the is_prime function,
	and we started on the Collatz project. A few days ago, I finally finished the HackerRank challenge. It was a good problem
	and I learned a lot while trying to optimize my code to pass all of the tests.
</p>
<b>What's in your way?</b>
<p>My time management this week has been a lot better compared to last week. I get to class around 5 minutes before class starts.
	That said, I think a major obstacle will be the recruiting events. Although I already have my internship for the summer,
	I am still going to recruiting events to see if there might be something interesting for the fall semester. Now, I have an
	interview scheduled for next week and career fairs start next week as well. I need to get ahead on my coursework now so that 
	I will have the time to attend the recruiting events for the next few weeks.
</p>
<b>What will you do next week?</b>
<p>I will first look to finish the Collatz project. Following that, I will need to complete my first assignment for Algorithms and
	Complexity. With those two done, I will be done with all the major work for next week. I will then spend the rest of my time 
	getting ahead on coursework, attending FOCS and recruiting events, and doing some personal projects.
</p>
<b>Whatâ€™s my experience of the class?</b>
<p>As we spend more time talking about good coding practices and testing, I feel that the quality of all the code I am
	outputting has improved a lot. I now keep track of issues on the GitHub issue tracker for my personal projects as well
	and I am enjoying the experience. I'm still not a fan of the daily 10am quizzes but I'm sure that I will get used to 
	that. </p>
<b>What's my pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?</b>
<p>Since we are using git log for the Collatz project, I thought I would mention 
	<a href="https://github.com/Fakerr/git-recall" target="_blank">git-recall</a>. It is a nice tool to look back 
	at your Git repo's history. It's not a game changer in any way but it is definitely easier than having to go 
	online or even look through git log.
