	<h1>Week 3</h1>
	<h3>Software Engineering (CS 373) Spring 2017</h3>
</header>
<b>What did you do this past week?</b>
<p>This week, I finished and turned in the Collatz project. The current workflow had some issues but in the end, 
	everything worked out. A guy from Bloomberg talked about his job during class on Wednesday. In was interesting
	to hear about his experience. In Algo, we had our first homework due this week as well. Nonetheless, it has not been
	too busy of a week. I have resumed work on a number of my personal projects. Namely, I am working on getting 
	some backend + machine learning integrated with my wallpaper. I have scripts that change my wallpaper automatically
	every day and an application where I can indicate whether I like the image or not. The next step, though, is to 
	make the app pick wallpapers based on what I like.
</p>
<b>What's in your way?</b>
<p>Right now, there really isn't much in my way. I have work done for the next two weeks for most of my classes. 
	I am looking forward to a really productive week.
</p>
<b>What will you do next week?</b>
<p>Career Fair is next week. For the sake of networking and swag, at the very least, I will be going. I need to get started 
	on the SWE readings earlier next week as well. Finally, I will be spending even more time on my personal projects. I
	have my partner for the next project as well. We will start on it early next week.
</p>
<b>Whatâ€™s my experience of the class?</b>
<p>I enjoyed class a lot this week. As others mentioned, though, having to change a number of things on the last few days
	was a bit annoying. I finished the project early last week but I had to keep going back to fix it. For example, copying
	from the temp file to the out file and changing my solution to include a non-meta-cache solution. It only took 45 
	minutes but I had to constanly check Piazza to ensure that I was not missing anything and I was making changes and resubmit 
	even 5 hours from the time it was due. I know that Prof. Downing did not expect us to all implement a pure meta-cache solution
	and I'm sure that this will be better for the remaining projects.
</p>
<b>What's my pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?</b>
<p>I highly recommend <a href="http://clarifai.com" target="_blank">Clarifai</a> I needed a simple image recognition 
	and machine learning tool for my project this week and 
	<a href="http://clarifai.com" target="_blank">Clarifai</a> was my immediate pick. It is extremely easy to install 
	and use. You can get a free API key and it has great tutorials. Give it an image and it will tell you what is in it. 
	Similarly, you can use concepts to search for images as well. Alternatively, you can feed images and train in to
	recognize whatever you want it to. If you do not want to do the training, it also has public trainings on Food, Travel,
	NSFW, Weddings, Color, Face Detection, Colors, etc.
