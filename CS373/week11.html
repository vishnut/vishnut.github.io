	<h1>Week 11</h1>
	<h3>Software Engineering (CS 373) Spring 2017</h3>
</header>
<b>What did you do this past week?</b>
<p>	I spent most of this week working on Phase 2 of the IDB project. The website has gone through a full redesign and 
	our database has been filled with thousands of rows for each model. The most difficult aspect of this phase was filling
	in all the gaps in the Crunchbase API. Our initial plan was to just pull from their API but we only realized the 
	deficiencies of this plan after scraping. Many fields were left blank and we had to use 5-6 other APIs and many more
	scripts just to fill in or clean up the remaining details. While we did finish several hours early on this phase, it was
	not without cost. I've been sleep-deprived and I certainly have not been eating properly. For one, I have lost 5 pounds
	over the last week and a half. Echoing what others in this class have noted, I should really take better care of my health.
</p>
<b>What's in your way?</b>
<p> I have an Algo Problem Set due soon. Having spent most of my time in class working on the SWE project, I am not entirely 
	sure what we have been doing. I'll need to review notes and catch up on the content.
</p>
<b>What will you do next week?</b>
<p> I'll need to first work on the Algo assignment. Once that is done, I will start work on Phase 3 of IDB project. Starting 
	early on the last phase really paid off and though I think Phase 3 will take less time than the first two phases, we should
	still start early and be prepared for any issues.
</p>
<b>Whatâ€™s my experience of the class?</b>
<p> This week of projects has been a lot of fun. Our website has turned out well and I really learned a lot over the last
	few weeks.
</p>
<b>What's my pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?</b>
<p> As the number of cars on the road increases, consider the issues with parking. While it is not currently an obvious
	problem in many areas of Texas, more densely populated areas have suffered over the last few years with this. As 
	population density increases in all large cities, this will soon be a problem for a lot more people. This
	<a href="https://www.economist.com/news/briefing/21720269-dont-let-people-park-free-how-not-create-traffic-jams-pollution-and-urban-sprawl">
	Economist article </a> discusses some possible solutions. While I don't personally agree with the idea of steep parking permits in 
	the US, I am not an urban planning expert. Right now, for most Americans, having a car is a necessity in order to 
	get to work. Expensive permits will only make it more difficult for the less fortunate to get to work. Given cheap and efficient public 
	transportation options, I believe that people will not feel the need to drive to work and one day, may not feel the need to own a car at all.<br/><br/>
