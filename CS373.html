									<h3><a href="CS373/week11.html">Week 11</a></h3>
									<p>I spent most of this week working on Phase 2 of the IDB project. The website has gone 
										through a full redesign and our database has been filled with thousands of rows for each

									<h3><a href="CS373/week9.html">Week 9</a></h3>

									<h3><a href="CS373/week7.html">Week 7</a></h3>
									<p>We had an exam in Software Engineering this week. It was not what I had expected and some
